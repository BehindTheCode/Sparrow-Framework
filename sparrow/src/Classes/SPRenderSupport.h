/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A class that contains helper methods simplifying OpenGL rendering.
 
 An SPRenderSupport instance is passed to any render: method. It saves information about the
 currently bound texture, which allows it to avoid unecessary texture switches.
 
 Furthermore, several static helper methods can be used for different needs whenever some
 OpenGL processing is required.
